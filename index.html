                        <p>A fair question, and the answer probably depends on your proximity to the panels - but some combination of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Property Values:</strong> Everywhere has a different opinion, ranging from "no effect" to "kiss goodbye to 25% of your property value". The largest study of its kind (commissioned by beneficiaries of the solar industry) reckoned that buyers will pay £600 GBP more per year (£15,000 GBP over the course of a regular mortgage) not to live within kilometers of a solar farm. This farm will be 100 times closer to our homes.</p>
                                <p>Don't think it'll only affect us, though. A solar farm in the village, especially so close to a large proportion of the houses is likely to affect prices farther afield, too</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Precedent:</strong> This is low-value land, on a floodplain - it can't be used for anything except this or grazing. This isn't just about this one solar farm - if this application goes through, it opens the flood gates, quite literally, to use almost any land in any location within the village, county and potentially wider, for solar farms.</p>
                                <p>It's us today, but it could be your neighbouring field or village tomorrow - and once one passes, the rest will be virtually unstoppable!</p>

                                <p><strong>Legal Process is being ignored:</strong> The plan states that the site is 0.9 hectares, but it's been established as > 1.0 hectare by the SAB (SuDS Approval Body). That means it qualifies as a "Major Development", which in turn means that there are all sorts of additional legal obligations which have been skipped, such as:</p>

                            <li><p><strong>The SuDS Approval Body (SAB) rejected it due to fundamental flaws!</strong></p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>No Bat Survey despite bats in the area:</strong> This is a requirement which has been skipped</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Because the plan is full of holes</strong>, including the one where the sewage pipe running through the field hasn't been mentioned in the plans, or brought up by the council who approved the original plans to install it a few years ago</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Because councillors made up their minds before considering feedback, and are willing to approve it in spite of government bodies explicitly telling them not to!</strong></p></li>

                        <p>On 15th January, 2024, an A4 paper notice was placed on the entrance gate to the field adjacent to Plas Trannon and Maes Trannon in Trefeglwys, announcing a Planning Application to build a 0.6 Megawatt solar farm on the field.</p>
                        <p>This website serves to document the community's response to the proposal itself, the process and council handling of it, and anything else which appears relevant, because attempts by the community to engage proactively with the council, and aspects of the "process" appear to be being "overlooked". Many valid concerns have been raised by the community via channels insisted on by the council, and they appear to have been ignored. The process is opaque and possibly being abused/subverted. Many within the community feel that the decision is a foregone conclusion, and actions and comments by councillors appear to support this.</p>
                        <p>We'll detail some of the contradictions, errors and omissions in the proposal, as well as legal matters being overlooked, timeline irregularities, etc.</p>

                        <p>As noted above, the community is feeding back our concerns via the <a href="https://pa.powys.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=consulteeComments&keyVal=SOSH1OMPJXC00" target="_blank">Make a Comment</a> tab on the Powys Government Planning Application Comments website, or via the email address provided on the notice placed on 15th January. So far, no one has received a response to any of these concerns. In light of this, and the fact that "In light of recent data protection incidents, it is considered that the risk resulting from publishing third party correspondence is too great", we've decided to publish our own thoughts for public dissemination.</p>
                        <p>(I mean, really, it's not too hard to anonymise comments, is it? They managed it for the councillor ones!)</p>
                        <p>We have also created a <a href="https://forms.gle/Uw6jD8jMhEw5VR2q9" target="_blank">Community Views Form</a>, in order to gauge and visualize community sentiment, as this is also sadly lacking from the process.</p>

                                        <li><p>"<strong>The requirement to obtain SAB consent sits outside of the planning process but is enforceable in a similar manner to planning law.

As such, there are significantly more requirements of the proposer, for example, a statutory 28 day pre-application consultation into the planning process.</p>
