    <h1>Trefeglwys Solar Farm Proposal - Community Response</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>On 15th January, 2024, an A4 paper notice was placed on the entrance gate to the field adjacent to Plas Trannon and Maes Trannon in Trefeglwys, announcing a Planning Application to build a 0.6 Megawatt solar farm on the field.</p>
    <p>This website serves to document the community's response to the proposal itself, the process and council handling of it, and anything else which appears relevant, because attempts by the community to engage proactively with the council, and aspects of the &quot;process&quot;
      appear to be being &quot;overlooked&quot;. Many valid concerns have been raised by the community via channels insisted on by the council, and they appear to have been ignored. The process is opaque and possibly being abused/subverted. Many within the community feel that the
      decision is a foregone conclusion, and actions and comments by councillors appear to support this.</p>
    <p>We'll detail some of the contradictions, errors and omissions in the proposal, as well as legal matters being overlooked, timeline irregularities, etc

    <h2>Planning Application Contents</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://pa.powys.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=SOSH1OMPJXC00" target="_new">details of the application can be found here</a></p>

    <h2>Community Feedback</h2>
    <p>As noted above, the community is feeding back our concerns via the <a href="https://pa.powys.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=consulteeComments&keyVal=SOSH1OMPJXC00" target="_new">Make a Comment</a> tab on the
      Powys Government Planning Application Comments website, or via the email address provided on the notice placed on 15th January. So far, no one has received a response to any of these concerns. In light of this, and the fact that
      &quot;In light of recent data protection incidents, it is considered that the risk resulting from publishing third party correspondence is too great&quot;, we've decided to publish our own correspondance and thoughts for public dissemination.</p>
    <p>We have also created a <a href="https://forms.gle/Uw6jD8jMhEw5VR2q9" target="_new">Community Views Form</a>, in order to guage and visualise community sentiment, as this is also sadly lacking from the process.</p>
