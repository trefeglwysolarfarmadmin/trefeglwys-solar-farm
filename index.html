        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>On 15th January, 2024, an A4 paper notice was placed on the entrance gate to the field adjacent to Plas Trannon and
          Maes Trannon in Trefeglwys, announcing a Planning Application to build a 0.6 Megawatt solar farm on the field.
        </p>
        <p>This website serves to document the community's response to the proposal itself, the process and council handling of
          it, and anything else which appears relevant, because attempts by the community to engage proactively with the council,
          and aspects of the &quot;process&quot; appear to be being &quot;overlooked&quot;. Many valid concerns have been raised
          by the community via channels insisted on by the council, and they appear to have been ignored. The process is opaque
          and possibly being abused/subverted. Many within the community feel that the decision is a foregone conclusion, and
          actions and comments by councillors appear to support this.
        </p>
        <p>We'll detail some of the contradictions, errors and omissions in the proposal, as well as legal matters being
         overlooked, timeline irregularities, etc.

        <h3>Community Feedback</h3>
        <p>As noted above, the community is feeding back our concerns via the

          tab on the Powys Government Planning Application Comments website, or via the email address provided on the notice
          placed on 15th January. So far, no one has received a response to any of these concerns. In light of this, and the
          fact that &quot;In light of recent data protection incidents, it is considered that the risk resulting from publishing
          third party correspondence is too great&quot;, we've decided to publish our own correspondance and thoughts for public
          dissemination.

        <p>We have also created a <a href="https://forms.gle/Uw6jD8jMhEw5VR2q9" target="_new">Community Views Form</a>, in order
          to guage and visualise community sentiment, as this is also sadly lacking from the process.

        <h3>Outstanding Questions</h3>
        <p>We would like, have asked (or now ask) and have yet to receive answers to the following questions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <div class="question">
              <p>Regarding the Consultee Comment on Tue 28 Jan 2025 entitled &quot;PCC-(N) Land Drainage&quot;, how have the matters raised been addressed? Specifically:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>&quot;Having reviewed the information provided by the applicant, <strong>the SAB deem the surface water drainage strategy (SWDS) is fundamentally flawed</strong>.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As the SAB deem the Surface Water Drainage Strategy (SWDS) as fundamentally flawed, <strong>the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) would recommend refusing the application</strong>strong> until such time as the applicant is able to demonstrate that a SAB Compliant SWDS is 
                      designed for the site&quot;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>&quot;No drainage details have been submitted with this application&quot;</p></li>
                  <li><p>&quot; If the applicant was to submit further information to confirm how the surface water is being managed and also indicated that it is being managed in a way that would be broadly SAB compliant, we would be happy to reconsider our recommendation
                    for refusal. <strong>Without further information, we would continue to recommend refusal</strong>.&quot;</p></li>
                  <li><p>&quot;<strong>The requirement to obtain SAB consent sits outside of the planning process but is enforceable in a similar manner to planning law. It is a requirement to obtain SAB consent in addition to planning consent</strong>. Failure to engage with compliant SuDS design
                    at an early stage may lead to significant unnecessary redesign costs.&quot;</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>How has this matter been addressed and resolved?</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p>Why did anonymous Ward Councillor, in their Consultee Comment on Wed 29 Jan 2025, the day after the above comment from the LLFA (Lead Local Flood Authority) state
                &quot;I am in general support of the application&quot; when there is an outstanding requirement to obtain SuDS Approval Body consent?</p>

            <div class="questions">
              <p>In the application, it is stated that the site is 0.9 hectares, but in the Consultee Comment from Land Drainage on 27 Jan 2025, the LLFA (Lead Local Flood Authority) states
                &quot;Furthermore, the SuDS Approval Body (SAB) deem that the construction area is greater than 100m2&quot;. 100m2 is 1 hectare, which is one of the qualifying thresholds for a &quot;Major Development&quot;. As such, there are
                significantly more requirements of the proposer, for example, a statutory 28 day pre-application consultation into the planning process.
              </p>
              <p>As members of the community, we are not aware of, and have not been involved in any pre-application consultation process.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If there is evidence to refute SAB's assessment of the site area, please could it be provided via the planning portal?</li>
                <li>If there is no evidence to the contrary, will the application be rejected on the basis that it has failed to meet its legal obligations?</li>
                <li>If the application will not be rejected on these grounds, please explain why these statutory requirements do not apply</li>
