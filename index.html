You can see the actual estates and a mock-up of the solar farm in the banner image above (credits in footer).</p>
                        <p>The plan places 1528 x 2.1 x 1.1 metre solar panels within less than 10 metres of some properties, directly in front of their living rooms, with no fences or other visual break inbetween. Please note that the mock-up is missing two large elevated buildings that should be on the left side of the photo, towering above the hedgerows and panels.</p>

                        <p>A fair question, and the answer probably depends on your proximity to the panels - but some combination of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Property Values:</strong> Opinions vary, ranging from "no effect" to "say goodbye to 25% of your property value". The largest study of its kind (commissioned by beneficiaries of the solar industry) found that buyers will pay £600 GBP more per year (£15,000 GBP over the course of a regular mortgage) not to live within kilometers of a solar farm. This farm will be 100 times closer to our homes.</p>
                                <p>Don't think it'll only affect us, though. A solar farm in the village, especially so close to a large proportion of the houses is likely to affect prices farther afield, too.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Precedent:</strong> This is low-value land, on a floodplain - it can't be used for anything except this or grazing. This isn't just about this one solar farm - if this application goes through, it opens the flood gates to use almost any land in any location within the village, county and potentially wider, for solar farms.</p>
                                <p>It's us today, but it could be your neighbouring field or village tomorrow - and once one passes, the rest will be virtually unstoppable!</p>

Local residents are aware of both Bats and Natterjack Toads in the area - the former are a regular sight around and over the proposed site and the latter have been seen. All of these, as well as Great Crested Newts (which may also be present) are protected under various UK and EU laws, and it's incumbant on the Local Planning Authority to request surveys of the applicant and delay development until they've been provided. The presence of these animals has been raised with the Local Planning Authority, through multiple objections. There are a further 14 species on Wales' protected lists for which there are records of them present within 1km of the proposed site.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Inconsistencies and Errors:</strong> The plan is full of inconsistencies, errors, omissions, exaggerations and &quot;liberties with the truth&quot;</p></li>

                              <p><strong>Bait and Switch</strong> - the applicant, Colin Powell's company, Powell Developments <a href="https://media.onthemarket.com/properties/3652873/doc_0_0.pdf" target="_blank">is the developer of the Plas Trannon and Maes Trannon housing estates</a>, directly adjoining the proposed solar farm. They sold many of these properties as &quot;Premium&quot;, achieving a tidy premium in the process, using phrases in the advertising such as:
                              <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://www.onthemarket.com/details/11843385/" target="_blank">&quot;Excellent far reaching valley views with southerly aspect&quot;</a></li>
                                <li><a href="https://www.onthemarket.com/details/11843385/" target="_blank">&quot;Potential buyers will be very impressed with ... the excellent sunny outlook over the garden and views across the Trannon Valley&quot;</a></li>

                              </ul>
                              <p>They told buyers that they couldn't build anything in this area of the field, due to it being a floodplain. Now, they intend to devalue all of these &quot;premium&quot; properties, built by and purchased from them, at the buyers' expense yet again, in what can only be described as an exhibition of moral bankruptcy.</p>
                              <p>They own at least 300 acres of land and have multiple properties currently on the market, where they've been for over a year because they're overpriced, but they don't need to sell them fast. They don't need to use this particular site, and they don't need to devalue anyone's house in order to build a solar farm. Indeed, they have a field outside their own house that they could use instead. This is pure developer greed, at our expense.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Councillors' Premature Decisions:</strong> Councillors publicly declared that they'd made up their minds before they were supposed to. Part way through the public notice period, and before they're legally allowed to discuss it with each other due to declared conflicts of interest, they'd already made up their minds.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Errors and Omissions Ignored: </strong> Councillors are happy to approve the plan in spite of all of the errors, glaring omissions, missed legal processes and government bodies (SAB) explicitly telling them they can't, as you'll see throughout this page</strong></p></li>

                                        <p>Consequently, we ask the following questions of the Local Planning Authority:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Who is going to remove the panels?</li>
                                            <li>What work is involved? By our amateur reckoning, at least: placing of temporary hardstanding, disconnection from the National Grid, removal of 1528 solar panels, removal of 40 sets of PV tables and up to 480 piles, removal of unknown other equipment housed in the 2 buildings, removal of the buildings, removal of the 600mm concrete bases to the buildings, removing temporary hardstanding, cleaning up, road and project management</li>
                                            <li>How much will all of this cost and what will the funding source be?</li>
                                            <li>If the applicant doesn't have to fund their removal, why not?</li>
                                            <li>Given the significant life-span of PV panels and other equipment, and the requirement for ongoing monitoring and maintenance as well as removal, what's the succession/continuity plan?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>There are significant laws in this area which haven't even been mentioned in passing, let alone satisfactorially addressed or mitigated. The installation, grid connection (G99 compliance,
                                            Distribution Network Operator (DNO) approval, protection devices, ensuring the system reaches all technical and safety standards), maintenance, grid disconnection and
                                            de-installation work all needs to be performed by qualified personnel, no doubt at significant expense.</p>
                                        <p>There's a glaring lack of acknowledgement of the work required to install, monitor, maintain and remove the SPEN sub-station and Electric Housing.</p>
                                        <p>These buildings will presumably contain inverters, batteries, wiring, high voltages and capacitances, a connection to the National Grid? Therefore we ask the same 5 questions as above about these - where are the provisions?</p>
                                    </li>

                                            inverters for an installation of this size will generate significant heat, for example, a representative efficiency of 95-98% means that 2-5% of the 825KWp (kilowatt-peak) system suggested
                                            here would mean 16.5 - 41.3 kW of heat generated, per hour, at peak. Batteries can be even less efficient (generate more heat) during charging and discharging cycles.</p>

Soil pipes are usually 600-1500mm deep, but may sometimes only be 300mm deep. The application isn't specific as to the depth of installation, but whatever their depth, if they follow the norm, it's clear that the piles will be inserted at least as deep as the soil pipe.</p>
                                        <p>The plans don't provide any assurance that the soil pipe won't be damaged, and the LPA doesn't appear to have requested such assurances.</p>
                                        <p>This seems like a critical thing to understand before planning can be approved?</p>
