      <section id="whats-occurring">
        <h3>What's Occurring?</h3>
        <p>A planning application has been submitted to install a giant solar farm into the middle of several housing estates, in
          the rural village of Trefeglwys in Powys, Wales. You can see the actual estates and a mock-up of the solar farm in the
          banner image above (credits in footer).
        </p>
        <p>The plan places 2000 x 2.1 x 1.1 metre solar panels within less than 10 metres of some properties, directly in front
          of their living rooms, with no fences or other visual break inbetween. Please note that the mock-up is missing
          the 2 elevated buildings that should be on the left side of the photo, towering above the hedgerows and panels.

      <section id="why-should-I-care">
        <h3>Why Should I Care?</h3>
        <p>A fair question, and the answer probably depends on your proximity to the panels - but some combination of:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Property Values:</strong> Everywhere has a different opinion, ranging from &quot;no effect&quot; to
                &quot;kiss goodbye to 25% of your property value&quot;. The largest study of its kind (commissioned by
                beneficiaries of the solar industry) reckoned that buyers will pay &pound;600 GBP more per year (&pound;15,000 GBP
                over the course of a regular mortgage) not to live within kilometers of a solar farm. This farm will be 100 times
                closer to our homes.
              </p>
              <p>Don't think it'll only affect us, though. A solar farm in the village, especially so close to a large proportion
                of the houses is likely to affect prices farther afield, too</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Precedent:</strong> This is low-value land, on a floodplain - it can't be used for anything except this or
                grazing. This isn't just about this one solar farm - if this application goes through, it opens the flood gates, quite
                literally, to use almost any land in any location within the village, county and potentially wider, for solar farms.
              </p>
              <p>It's us today, but it could be your neighbouring field or village tomorrow - and once one passes, the rest will be
                virtually unstoppable!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Legal Process is being ignored:</strong> The plan states that the site is 0.9 hectares, but it's been
                established as &gt; 1.0 hectare by the SAB (SuDS Approval Body). That means it qualifies as a &quot;Major Development&quot;,
                which in turn means that there are all sorts of additional legal obligations which have been skipped, such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Making draft planning application documents available to view</li>
                  <li>Providing a 28 day pre-application consultation period</li>
                  <li>Reporting on how the pre-application consultation was undertaken and how peoples views were considered, in a
                    'Pre-Application Consultation Report', submitted as part of the application</li>
                  <li>Providing written notice to all owners/occupiers of land adjoining the site</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Late-breaking changes to plans which should affect key decisions are being overlooked</strong></li>
            <li><p><strong>The SuDS Approval Body (SAB) rejected it due to fundamental flaws!</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>No Bat Survey despite bats in the area: </strong> This is a requirement which has been skipped</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Because the plan is full of holes</strong>, including the one where the sewage pipe running through the field hasn't
              been mentioned in the plans, or brought up by the council who approved the original plans to install it a few years
              ago</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Because councillors made up their minds before considering feedback, and are willing to approve it in spite
              of government bodies explicitly telling them not to!</strong></p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <section id="introduction">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>On 15th January, 2024, an A4 paper notice was placed on the entrance gate to the field adjacent to Plas Trannon and
          Maes Trannon in Trefeglwys, announcing a Planning Application to build a 0.6 Megawatt solar farm on the field.
        </p>
        <p>This website serves to document the community's response to the proposal itself, the process and council handling of
          it, and anything else which appears relevant, because attempts by the community to engage proactively with the council,
          and aspects of the &quot;process&quot; appear to be being &quot;overlooked&quot;. Many valid concerns have been raised
          by the community via channels insisted on by the council, and they appear to have been ignored. The process is opaque
          and possibly being abused/subverted. Many within the community feel that the decision is a foregone conclusion, and
          actions and comments by councillors appear to support this.
        </p>
        <p>We'll detail some of the contradictions, errors and omissions in the proposal, as well as legal matters being
         overlooked, timeline irregularities, etc.

        <h3>Community Feedback</h3>
        <p>As noted above, the community is feeding back our concerns via the
          <a href="https://pa.powys.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=consulteeComments&keyVal=SOSH1OMPJXC00" target="_new">Make a Comment</a>
          tab on the Powys Government Planning Application Comments website, or via the email address provided on the notice
          placed on 15th January. So far, no one has received a response to any of these concerns. In light of this, and the
          fact that &quot;In light of recent data protection incidents, it is considered that the risk resulting from publishing
          third party correspondence is too great&quot;, we've decided to publish our own thoughts for public dissemination.
        </p>
        <p>(I mean, really, it's not too hard to anonymise comments, is it? They managed it for the councillor ones!)</p>
        <p>We have also created a <a href="https://forms.gle/Uw6jD8jMhEw5VR2q9" target="_new">Community Views Form</a>, in order
          to guage and visualise community sentiment, as this is also sadly lacking from the process.

        <h3>Outstanding Questions</h3>
        <p>We would like, have asked (or now ask) and have yet to receive answers to the following questions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <div class="question">
              <p>Regarding the Consultee Comment on Tue 28 Jan 2025 entitled &quot;PCC-(N) Land Drainage&quot;, how have the matters
                raised been addressed? Specifically:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>&quot;Having reviewed the information provided by the applicant, <strong>the SAB deem the surface water drainage strategy (SWDS) is fundamentally flawed</strong>.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As the SAB deem the Surface Water Drainage Strategy (SWDS) as fundamentally flawed, <strong>the Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) would recommend refusing the application</strong> until such time as the applicant is able to demonstrate that a SAB Compliant SWDS is 
                      designed for the site&quot;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>&quot;No drainage details have been submitted with this application&quot;</p></li>
                  <li><p>&quot; If the applicant was to submit further information to confirm how the surface water is being managed and also indicated that it is being managed in a way that would be broadly SAB compliant, we would be happy to reconsider our recommendation
                    for refusal. <strong>Without further information, we would continue to recommend refusal</strong>.&quot;</p></li>
                  <li><p>&quot;<strong>The requirement to obtain SAB consent sits outside of the planning process but is enforceable in a similar manner to planning law. It is a requirement to obtain SAB consent in addition to planning consent</strong>. Failure to engage with compliant SuDS design
                    at an early stage may lead to significant unnecessary redesign costs.&quot;</p></li>
                </ol>

              <p>In the application, it is stated that the site is 0.9 hectares, but in the Consultee Comment from Land Drainage on 27 Jan 2025, the LLFA (Lead Local Flood Authority) states
                &quot;Furthermore, the SuDS Approval Body (SAB) deem that the construction area is greater than 100m2&quot;. 100m2 is 1 hectare, which is one of the qualifying thresholds for a &quot;Major Development&quot;. As such, there are
                significantly more requirements of the proposer, for example, a statutory 28 day pre-application consultation into the planning process.
